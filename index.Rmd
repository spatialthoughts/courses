title: 'Spatial Thoughts OpenCourseWare'
---

We offer a range of courses to help people upgrade their skills and use modern spatial analysis tools effectively. Our course materials are shared freely and under an open license suitable for self-study as well as adaptation by other trainers. You can access the courses through the links below.

## Courses 

These courses are also offered as online instructor-led classes. The online classes cover these materials in much more depth - with discussion, Q&A and support - in a unique teaching style that helps you to learn the nuances and apply these skills to your own spatial analysis problems. We are also a QGIS.org certifying organization and offer affordable programs to earn globally recognized official QGIS.org certification.
