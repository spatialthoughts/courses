# Advanced Supervised Classification Techniques

## k-Fold Cross Validation

In regular accuracy assessment we split the samples into 2 fractions of training and validation. In k-fold cross validation, this step is repeated multiple times by splitting the data into multiple subsets (i.e folds), using one of these folds as a validation set, and training the model on the remaining folds. This process is repeated multiple times and the accuracy metric from each validation step is averaged to produce a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/Supplement/Supervised_Classification/KFold_Cross_Validation')}
```

## Hyperparameter Tuning

A recommended best practice for improving the accuracy of your machine learning model is to tune different parameters. For example, when using the `ee.Classifier.smileRandomForest()` classifier, we must specify the *Number of Trees*. We know that higher number of trees result in more computation requirement, but it doesn't necessarily result in better results. Instead of guessing, we programmatically try a range of values and choose the smallest value possible that results in the highest accuracy.

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/Supplement/Supervised_Classification/Hyperparameter_Tuning')}
```


## Post-Processing Classification Results

Supervised classification results often contain salt-and-pepper noise caused by mis-classified pixels. It is usually preferable to apply some post-processing techniques to remove such noise. The following script contains the code for two popular techniques for post-processing classification results.

* Using un-supervised clustering to replacing classified value by majority value in each cluster.
* Replacing isolated pixels with surrounding value with a majority filter.

> Remember that the neighborhood methods are scale-dependent so the results will change as you zoom in/out. Export the results at the desired scale to see the effect of post-processing.

```

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/Supplement/Supervised_Classification/Post_Processing_Classification_Results')}
```

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is a very useful technique in improving your supervised classification results. This is a statistical technique that compresses data from a large number of bands into fewer uncorrelated bands. You can run PCA on your image and add the first few (typically 3) principal component bands to the original composite before sampling training points. In the example below, you will notice that 97% of the variance from the 13-band original image is captured in the 3-band PCA image. This sends a stronger signal to the classifier and improves accuracy by allowing it to distinguish different classes better.

knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/pca.png')
```

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/Supplement/Supervised_Classification/Principal_Components_Analysis')}
```


## Multi-temporal Composites for Crop Classification

Crop classification is a difficult problem. A useful technique that aids in clear distinction of crops is to account for crop phenology. This technique can be applied to detect a specific type of crop or distinguish crops from other forms of vegetation. You can create composite images for different periods of the cropping cycle and create a stacked image to be used for classification. This allows the classifier to learn the temporal pattern and detect pixels that exhibit similar patterns.


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap='Capturing Crop Phenology through Seasonal Composites'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/seasonal_composite.png')
```

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/Supplement/Supervised_Classification/Seasonal_Composites_for_Crop_Classification')}
```

## Computing Correlation

A useful technique to aid crop classification is to model the correlation between precipitation and changes in vegetation. This allows the model to capture differentiated responses to rainfall (i.e. raid-fed crops vs permanent forests).  We first prepare an image collection where each image consists of 2 bands - cumulative rainfall for each month and average NDVI for the next month. This will create 11 images per year which show precipitation and 1-month lagged NDVI at each pixels. The collection is then reduced using the `ee.Reducer.pearsonsCorrelation()` which outputs a `correlation` band. Positive values will show regions where precipitation caused an increase in NDVI. Adding this band to your input image for classification will greatly aid the classifier in separating different types of vegetation.

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/Supplement/Supervised_Classification/Rainfall_NDVI_Correlation')}
```

## Calculating Band Correlation Matrix

When selecting features for your machine learning model, it is important to have features which are not correlated with each other. Correlated features makes it difficult for machine learning models to discover the interactions between different features. A commonly used technique to aid in removing redundant variables is to create a Correlation Matrix. In Earth Engine, you can take a multi-band image and calculate pair-wise correlation between the bands using either `ee.Reducer.pearsonsCorrelation()` or `ee.Reducer.spearmansCorrelation()`. The correlation matrix helps you identify variables that are redundant and can be removed. The code below also shows how to export the table of features that can be used in other software to compute correlation.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%', fig.cap='Correlation Matrix created in Python using data exported from GEE'}

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/Supplement/Supervised_Classification/Correlation_Matrix')}
```


## Calculating Area by Class

This code snippet shows how to use a [Grouped Reducer](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/reducers_grouping) to calculate area covered by each class in a classified image. It also shows how to use the `ui.Chart.feature.byProperty()` function to create a column chart and the `ui.Chart.feature.byFeature()` function to create a pie chart with areas of each class.

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/Supplement/Supervised_Classification/Calculating_Area_by_Class')}
```

## Spectral Signature Plots

For supervised classification, it is useful to visualize average spectral responses for each band for each class. Such charts are called *Spectral Response Curves* or *Spectral Signatures*. Such charts helps determine separability of classes. If classes have very different signatures, a classifier will be able to separate them well.

We can also plot spectral signatures of all training samples for a class and check the quality of the training dataset. If all training samples show similar signatures - it indicates that you have done a good job of collecting appropriate samples. You can also catch potential outliers from these plots.

These charts provide a qualitative and visual methods for checking separability of classes. For quantitative methods, one can apply measures such as Spectral Distance, Mahalanobis distance, Bhattacharyya distance , Jeffreys-Matusita (JM) distance etc. You can find the code for these in [this Stack Exchange answer](https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/323778/5160).

## Stratified Sampling of GCPs

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/Supplement/Supervised_Classification/Stratified_Sampling')}
```

## Identify Misclassified GCPs

While doing accuracy assessment, you will see the validation features that were not classified correctly. It is useful to visually see the points that were misclassified. We can use `ee.Filter.eq()` and `ee.Filter.neq()` filters to filter the features where the actual and predicted classes were different. The code below shows how to implement this and also use the `style()` function visualize them effectively.

## Image Normalization and Standardization

For machine learning, it is a recommended practice to either normalize or standardize your features. The code below shows how to implement these feature scaling techniques.

## Calculate Feature Importance 

Many classifiers in GEE have a `explain()` method that calculates feature importances. The classifier will assign a score to each input variable on how useful they were at predicting the correct value. The script below shows how to extract the feature importance and create a chart to visualize it.

## Conflict Mapping

During the [Israel-Palestine Crisis of 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Israel%E2%80%93Palestine_crisis), Gaza was bombed heavily during May 2021. We are able to monitor and detect bombed sites using Sentinel-2 images captured before and after the bombing. Jamon Van Den Hoek put together a [Google Earth Engine App](https://jamonvdh.users.earthengine.app/view/gaza-bomb-damage-analysis) with his analysis of the bombing. The script below is an adaptation with open-source code showing how to carry out such mapping using change detection techniques.

## Filter Images by Cloud Cover in a Region

This script shows how to calculate the cloud cover in a region, and set an image property with the cloud cover for a given region. We can then apply a filter to select images having no cloud cover in the region. This is useful where you are working in a very cloudy region and want to ensure that you are filtering for clouds in your region of interest, instead of the whole scene.

## Landsat Timelapse Animation with Text

We can build a collection of cloud-free annual composites from the [Harmonized Landsat Time Series](#harmonized-landsat-time-series) and create a timelapse animation. Since Earth Engine does not have a built-in way to render text, we leverage Gennadii Donchyts's [`text` package](https://github.com/gee-community/ee-packages-js) for adding text overlay of the year on the images. The exported video can be converted to an animated GIF using https://ezgif.com/.

```

## Percentile Composites

When working in a very cloudy region you may still be left with majority of the images contaminated with cloudy pixels. You may apply a cloud-mask to remove them but many cloud masking algorithms may miss thin clouds or fog. A median composite takes the 50th percentile value from the image stack to create the final image. When you expect most images to have clouds, the 50th percentile (median) value could still be cloudy. In such cases, you can use the `ee.Reducer.percentile()` to create composite that uses the value at a lower percentile to ensure a cloud-free observation.

[Open in Code Editor &#8599;](https://code.earthengine.google.co.in/?scriptPath=users%2Fujavalgandhi%2FEnd-to-End-GEE%3ASupplement%2FImage_Collections%2FPercentile_Composites){target="_blank"}
```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/Supplement/Image_Collections/Percentile_Composites')}
```

## Medoid Composites

Medoid or Multi Dimensional Median is often used to get a more representative sample from multi-dimensional data. For multispectral satellite images - a medoid composite can result in a better output than a simple median composite. The method and its advantages are described in the paper [Seasonal Composite Landsat TM/ETM+ Images Using the Medoid](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/5/12/6481). You can also use a Geometric Median which is similar to a medoid but it does not impose the constraint that the values must be from the same observation. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/medoid.png')
```

Some key differences between a simple median composite vs. a medoid composite:

1. Median values are calculated independently for each band while Medoid value is computed by comparing pixel values across all bands and selecting the values that minimize the difference  between the median and the chosen value.
2. In a median composite image, each band value may come from different images. Medoid values are guaranteed to come from the same image.
3. Median composites may have values that are not present in the original images. i.e. Median of [1, 2, 3, 4] --> 2.5. Medoid will always pick values present in the input data.

For most users, the difference is minimal and a simple median composite will be adequate. However, median composites can sometimes produce outliers when computing spectral indices (like NDVI) whereas medoid composites are more robust against such outliers.

## Derive LST from Landsat Images

Many researchers are interested in studying the effects of climate change and the urban environment. Landsat sensors have thermal bands which makes it possible to study these interactions at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The script below shows how to compute LST using two different methods.

- Method 1: Using the [LST Computation Algorithm by Sofia Ermida](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/9/1471).
- Method 2: Using [Landsat Collection 2 Level 2 Dataset](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-collection-2-surface-temperature).

> Warning: LST has poor correlation with thermal stress experienced by humans. Users should not use satellite-derived LST as a proxy for measurement or mitigation of exposure to heat.

## Gap-filling of Landsat 7 SLC-Off Images

The Scan Line Corrector (SLC) failed on the Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor in May 2003, resulting in wedge-shaped scan line gaps. USGS has developed and published a [methodology](https://www.usgs.gov/media/files/landsat-7-slc-gap-filled-products-phase-two-methodology) to fill these scan lines using a linear regression over a moving window. A simpler-version of this algorithm has been adapted for Google Earth Engine and provided here.

# User Interface Templates

## Adding a Discrete Legend

You may want to add a legend for a classified image to your map visualization in your App. Here's a code snippet that shows how you can build it using the UI Widgets.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap='Creating a Discrete Map Legend'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/map_legend.png')
```

[Open in Code Editor &#8599;](https://code.earthengine.google.co.in/?scriptPath=users%2Fujavalgandhi%2FEnd-to-End-GEE%3ASupplement%2FUI_Widgets_and_Apps%2FMap_Legend){target="_blank"}

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/Supplement/UI_Widgets_and_Apps/Map_Legend')}
```

## Adding a Continous Legend

If you are displaying a raster layer in your app with a color palette, you can use the following technique to add a colorbar using the snipet below.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap='Creating a Continuous Raster Legend'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/colorbar.png')
```

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/Supplement/UI_Widgets_and_Apps/Colorbar_Legend')}
```

## Change Visualization UI App

A common use-case for Earth Engine Apps is to display 2 images in a split panel app. Below script contains a simple template that you can use to create an interactive split panel app. Here we have 2 map objects - `leftMap` and `rightMap`. You can add different images to each of the maps and users will be able to explore them side-by-side. ![[View Animated GIF &#8599;](https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/images/end_to_end_gee/dust_storm_app.gif){target="_blank"}]

## NDVI Explorer UI App

Earth Engine Apps allow you to display interactive charts in response to user action. This app shows the common design pattern to build an app that allows the user to click anywhere on the map and obtain a chart using the clicked-location.


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap='Global NDVI Explorer App'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/global_ndvi_explorer.png')
```

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/Supplement/UI_Widgets_and_Apps/NDVI_Explorer_UI_App')}
```


## App with Layer Control

We can use the `ui.CheckBox()` widget along with `ui.Map.Layer()` objects to build a custom layer control that allows users to select which layers are visible on the map.

# Code Sharing and Script Modules

As your Earth Engine project grows, you need a way to organize and share your code to collaborate with others. We will learn some best practices on how best to set-up your project in Earth Engine.

## Sharing a Single Script

To share your code from a single script, you need to use the **Get Link** button in the code editor. As you click the button, the contents of your code editor is captured and encoded into a URL. When you share this URL with someone, they will be able see same content as your code editor. This is a great way to send a snapshot of your code so others can reproduce your output. Remember that the script links are just snapshots, if you change your code after sending the link to someone, they will not see the updates.

> When trying to send someone a link, do NOT click the *Copy Script Path* button. Sending this path to someone will NOT give them access to your code. The script path only works only on public or shared repositories. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%', fig.cap='Code Sharing using Get Link button'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/get_link.png')
```


While sharing the script using *Get Link*, you should also share any private **Assets** that you may have uploaded and are using in the script. You can share the asset with a specific email address, or check the *Anyone can read* box if you want anyone with the script link to be able to access it. Failing to do so will prevent others from running your script.


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%', fig.cap='Sharing Uploaded Assets'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/sharing_assets.png')
```

Learn more in the [Script links](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/playground#get-link) section of the Google Earth Engine User Guide.


## Sharing Multiple Scripts

If you want to share a collection of scripts with other users or your collaborators, the best way is to create a new **Repository**. 


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='40%', fig.cap='Creating New Repository'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/new_repository.png')
```

You can put multiple scripts within the repository and share the repository with other users. You can grant them **Reader** or **Writer** access so they can view/add/modify/delete scripts in that repository. If you want to make it readable by **Public**, you can check the *Anyone can read* option. You will see a URL in the form of `https://code.earthengine.google.co.in/?accept_repo=...`. When you share this URL with other users and they visit that link, your repository will be added to their Code Editor under the *Reader* or *Writer* folder depending on their access.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%', fig.cap='Creating New Repository'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/sharing_repository.png')
```

Learn more in the [Script Manager](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/playground#script-manager-scripts-tab) section of the Google Earth Engine User Guide.


## Sharing Code between Scripts

For a large project, it is preferable to share commonly used functions between scripts. That way, each script doesn't have to re-implement the same code. Earth Engine enables this using **Script Modules**. Using a special object called `exports`, you can expose a function to other scripts. Learn more in the [Script modules](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/playground#script-modules) section of the Google Earth Engine User Guide.

There are many Earth Engine users who have shared their repositories publicly and written script modules to perform a variety of tasks. Here's an example of using the `grid` module from the `users/gena/packages` repository to create regularly spaced grids in Earth Engine.


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap='Using a function from a script module'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/script_modules.png')
```
