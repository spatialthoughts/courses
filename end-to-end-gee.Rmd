# Introduction 

Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform that enables large-scale processing of satellite imagery to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth’s surface. This course covers the full range of topics in Earth Engine to give the participants practical skills to master the platform and implement their remote sensing projects.

# Module 1: Earth Engine Basics

Module 1 is designed to give you basic skills to be able to find datasets you need for your project, filter them to your region of interest, apply basic processing and export the results. Mastering this will allow you to start using Earth Engine for your project quickly and save a lot of time pre-processing the data.

## 01. Hello World

This script introduces the basic Javascript syntax. To learn more, visit [Introduction to JavaScript for Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/tutorial_js_01) section of the Earth Engine User Guide. 

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/01b_Hello_World_(complete)')}
```

### Exercise

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/01c_Hello_World_(exercise)')}
```

### Saving Your Work

When you modify any script for the course repository, you may want to save a copy for yourself. If you try to click the *Save* button, you will get an error message like below

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/setup1.png')
```

This is because the shared class repository is a *Read-only* repository. You can click *Yes* to save a copy in your own repository. If this is the first time you are using Earth Engine, you will be prompted to choose the name of your *home folder*. Choose the name carefully, as it cannot be changed once created.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/setup2.png')
```

## 02. Working with Image Collections

Most datasets in Earth Engine come as a `ImageCollection`. An ImageCollection is a dataset that consists of images takes at different time and locations - usually from the same satellite or data provider. You can load a collection by searching the [Earth Engine Data Catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets) for the *ImageCollection ID*. Search for the *Sentinel-2 Level 1C* dataset and you will find its id `COPERNICUS/S2_SR`.

Before you do anything with the collection, it is useful to see information about a single image contained in the collection. The `first()` function extracts the first image in the collection. You can then `print()` the result to see the bands and metadata contained in that image.

To see the collection on a map, we need to use `Map.addLayer()` function. But before that we need to know some parameters. The Earth Engine data catalog provides suggested visualization parameters for all collections. Visit the [Sentinel-2, Level 1C page](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S2) and see *Explore in Earth Engine* section to find the visualization parameters. We can use these to add the collection to the map.


```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/02b_Image_Collections_(complete)')}
```

### Exercise

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/02c_Image_Collections_(exercise)')}
```

## 03. Filtering Image Collections

The collection contains all imagery ever collected by the sensor. The entire collections are not very useful. Most applications require a subset of the images. We use **filters** to select the appropriate images. There are many types of filter functions, look at `ee.Filter...` module to see all available filters. Select a filter and then run the `filter()` function with the filter parameters. 

We will learn about 3 main types of filtering techniques

* Filter by metadata: You can apply a filter on the image metadata using filters such as `ee.Filter.eq()`, `ee.Filter.lt()` etc. You can filter by PATH/ROW values, Orbit number, Cloud cover etc.
* Filter by date: You can select images in a particular date range using filters such as `ee.Filter.date()`.
* Filter by location: You can select the subset of images with a bounding box, location or geometry using the `ee.Filter.bounds()`. You can also use the drawing tools to draw a geometry for filtering.

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/03b_Filtering_Image_Collection_(complete)')}
```

### Exercise

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/03c_Filtering_Image_Collection_(exercise)')}
```

## 04. Sorting, Mosaicing and Compositing Image Collections

The default order of the collection is by date. So when you display the the collection, it implicitely creates a mosaic with the latest pixels in top. You can call `.mosaic()` on a ImageCollection to create a mosaic image from the pixels at the top.

We can sort the collection differently before mosaicing using the `sort()` function. Here we create a mosaic with the most cloud-free image on top.

We can also create composite image by applying a selection criteria to each pixel from all pixels in the stack. Here we use the `median()` function to create a composite where each pixel value is the median of all pixels from the stack.

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/04b_Sorting_Mosaicing_Compositing_(complete)')}
```

### Exercise

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/04c_Sorting_Mosaicing_Compositing_(exercise)')}
```

## 05. Working with Feature Collections

Feature Collections are similar to Image Collections - but they contain *Features*, not images. They are equivalent to Vector Layers in a GIS. We can load, filter and display Feature Collections using similar techniques that we have learnt so far. 

Search for *GAUL Second Level Administrative Boundaries* and load the collection. This is a global collection that contain all Admin2 boundaries. We can apply a filter using the `ADM1_NAME` property to get all Admin2 boundaries (i.e. Districts) from a state.

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/05b_Feature_Collections_(complete)')}
```

### Exercise

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/05c_Feature_Collections_(exercise)')}
```

## 06. Importing Data

You can import vector or raster data into Earth Engine. We will now import a shapefile of [Urban Areas](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-urban-area/) for Natural Earth. Unzip the `ne_10m_urban_areas.zip` into a folder on your computer. In the Code Editor, go to *Assets &rarr; New &rarr; Table Upload &rarr; Shape Files*. Select the `.shp`, `.shx`, `.dbf` and .`prj` files. Enter `ne_10m_urban_areas` as the *Asset Name* and click  *Upload*. Once the upload and ingest finishes, you will have a new asset in the *Assets* tab. The shapefile is imported as a Feature Collection in Earth Engine. Select the `ne_10m_urban_areas` asset and click *Import*.  You can then visualize the imported data.


```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/06b_Import_(complete)')}
```

### Exercise

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/06c_Import_(exercise)')}
```

## 07. Clipping Images

It is often desirable to clip the images to your area of interest. You can use the `clip()` function to mask out an image using a geometry.

> While in a Desktop software, clipping is desirable to remove unneccesary portion of a large image and save computation time, in Earth Engine clipping can actually increase the computation time. As described in the [Earth Engine Coding Best Practices](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/best_practices?hl=en#if-you-dont-need-to-clip,-dont-use-clip) guide, avoid clipping the images or do it at the end of your script.

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/07b_Clipping_(complete)')}
```

### Exercise

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/07c_Clipping_(exercise)')}
```

## 08. Exporting Data

Earth Engine allows for exporting both vector and raster data to be used in an external program. Vector data can be exported as a `CSV` or a `Shapefile`, while Rasters can be exported as `GeoTIFF` files. We will now export the Sentinel-2 Composite as a GeoTIFF file.

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/08b_Export_(complete)')}
```

### Exercise

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/08c_Export_(exercise)')}
```
