Google Earth Engine requires all users to sign-up for an account. This account is linked with Google Cloud and users must create a Google Cloud Project to use the service. If you have a legacy Earth Engine account, it must be linked to a Google Cloud Project to continue using GEE. 

We have put together a simplified FAQ and step-by-step guide below for users who may not be familiar with Google Cloud. 

----

### FAQ 

* **Why the requirement for a Cloud Project?** Previously - Earth Engine was a separate Google service with it's own systems and was governed by its own Terms of Service. It is now integrated with Google Cloud Platform and is one of hundreds of other cloud offerings. This means that the usage of GEE is now governed by the *Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service* and it uses the standard cloud systems for access, logging, billing etc. It helps Earth Engine team offer better integration with other Google Cloud offerings. Using Google Cloud requires a *Project* - which is just a workspace where you can enable different services.
* **Should I sign-up for a Cloud Project?** As of November 2024, you do not have an option to use Earth Engine without a cloud project. If you do not link your existing account with a Cloud Project, your GEE account will stop functioning at some point in the future.
* **What happens to my scripts and assets?** Your existing scripts and assets will remain in your account and you can continue using them as normal after linking the account with a Cloud Project.
* **Do I have to pay for Google Cloud?** Earth Engine remains free for [Noncommercial and Research Use](https://earthengine.google.com/noncommercial/). You do not need to setup a billing account or pay if you qualify for this category. For [Commercial Use](https://earthengine.google.com/commercial/), you will need to setup a billing account and choose a [Pricing Plan](https://cloud.google.com/earth-engine/pricing).

### Sign-up Flow

1. On the *Product Registration Page*, provide details like `Project name`, `Organization` and `Location`. You can also proceed with `No Organization` option.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/gee_sign_up/cloud1.png')
```

2. On the *Configuration* page, click on `Verify` to proceed with the registration.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/gee_sign_up/cloud2.png')
```

3. In the first configuration step, *Select your organization type* as `Earth Engine trainer or trainee` and click *Next*.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/gee_sign_up/cloud3.png')
```

4. Next, you are at the step to *Check noncommercial eligibility*. Choose your role as `Participant` and provide start and end dates for the course. After clicking on `Check eligibility`, you will see the note that stating that you are eligible for non commercial Earth Engine. Click `Next` to proceed.  

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(
  c('images/gee_sign_up/cloud4a.png',
    'images/gee_sign_up/cloud4b.png')
)
```

5. Under the *Choose your plan* section, you will see a note of `A pricing plan is not required for noncommercial project`. Simply click `Next` and proceed.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/gee_sign_up/cloud5.png')
```

6. To *Describe your work*, choose `Classroom or education` in the drop-down and click `Next`.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='50%'}

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/gee_sign_up/cloud8.png')
```

9.visit the [Earth Engine Code Editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com). Your code editor will now display information about the linked project.
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/gee_sign_up/cloud9.png')
```

Done! You are now ready to start using your Earth Engine account with a Cloud Project.
