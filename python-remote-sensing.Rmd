# Introduction 

XArray is a powerful Python package for working with climate and earth observation datasets. Inspired by libraries like pandas - it is particularly suited for working with multi-dimensional time-series raster datasets. With the growing ecosystem of spatial extensions like rioxarray and xarray-spatial and built-in support for parallel computing with Dask, it has become the de-facto standard for working with large spatio-temporal raster datasets. This workshop will show you how you can use it to effectively process large volumes of earth observation data.

# 1. Learning XArray

[`XArray`](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/) has emerged as one of the key Python libraries to work with gridded raster datasets. It can natively handle time-series data making it ideal for working with Remote Sensing datasets. It builds on NumPy/Pandas for fast arrays/indexing and is orders of magnitude faster than other Python libraries like `rasterio`. It has a growing ecosystem of extensions `rioxarray`, `xarray-spatial`, `XEE` and more allowing it to be used for geospatial analysis. In this section, we will learn the fundamentals of XArray with a focus on earth observation data processing. XArray offers the flexibility to seamlessly work with local datasets along with cloud-hosted datasets in a variety of optimized data formats.

# 2. Scaling Computation with Dask

[`Dask`](https://www.dask.org/) is a python library to run your computation in parallel across many machines. Dask has built-in support for key geospatial packages like XArray and Pandas allowing you to scale your computation easily. You can choose to run your code in parallel on your laptop, a machine in the cloud, local or cloud cluster of machines etc.
