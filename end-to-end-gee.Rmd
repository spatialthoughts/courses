# Module 1: Earth Engine Basics

Module 1 is designed to give you basic skills to be able to find datasets you need for your project, filter them to your region of interest, apply basic processing and export the results. Mastering this will allow you to start using Earth Engine for your project quickly and save a lot of time pre-processing the data.

## 01. Hello World

This script introduces the basic Javascript syntax and the video covers the programming concepts you need to learn when using Earth Engine. To learn more, visit [Introduction to JavaScript for Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/tutorial_js_01) section of the Earth Engine User Guide.

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/01c_Hello_World_(exercise)')}
```

### Saving Your Work

When you modify any script for the course repository, you may want to save a copy for yourself. If you try to click the *Save* button, you will get an error message like below

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/setup1.png')
```

This is because the shared class repository is a *Read-only* repository. You can click *Yes* to save a copy in your repository. If this is the first time you are using Earth Engine, you will be prompted to choose a *Earth Engine username*. Choose the name carefully, as it cannot be changed once created.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/setup2.png')
```

After entering your username, your home folder will be created. After that, you will be prompted to enter a new repository. A repository can help you organize and share code. Your account can have multiple repositories and each repository can have multiple scripts inside it. To get started, you can create a repository named *default*. Finally, you will be able to save the script.

## 02. Working with Image Collections

Most datasets in Earth Engine come as a `ImageCollection`. An ImageCollection is a dataset that consists of images takes at different time and locations - usually from the same satellite or data provider. You can load a collection by searching the [Earth Engine Data Catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets) for the *ImageCollection ID*. Search for the *Sentinel-2 Level 1C* dataset and you will find its id `COPERNICUS/S2_SR`. Visit the [Sentinel-2, Level 1C page](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S2) and see *Explore in Earth Engine* section to find the code snippet to load and visualize the collection. This snippet is a great starting point for your work with this dataset. Click the **Copy Code Sample** button and paste the code into the code editor. Click *Run* and you will see the image tiles load in the map.


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/image_collection1.png')
```

In the code snippet, You will see a function `Map.setCenter()` which sets the viewport to a specific location and zoom level. The function takes the X coordinate (longitude), Y coordinate (latitude) and Zoom Level parameters. Replace the X and Y coordinates with the coordinates of your city and click *Run* to see the images of your city.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/image_collection2.png')
```

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/02c_Image_Collections_(exercise)')}
```

## 03. Filtering Image Collections

The collection contains all imagery ever collected by the sensor. The entire collections are not very useful. Most applications require a subset of the images. We use **filters** to select the appropriate images. There are many types of filter functions, look at `ee.Filter...` module to see all available filters. Select a filter and then run the `filter()` function with the filter parameters. 

We will learn about 3 main types of filtering techniques

* **Filter by metadata**: You can apply a filter on the image metadata using filters such as `ee.Filter.eq()`, `ee.Filter.lt()` etc. You can filter by PATH/ROW values, Orbit number, Cloud cover etc.
* **Filter by date**: You can select images in a particular date range using filters such as `ee.Filter.date()`.
* **Filter by location**: You can select the subset of images with a bounding box, location or geometry using the `ee.Filter.bounds()`. You can also use the drawing tools to draw a geometry for filtering.

After applying the filters, you can use the `size()` function to check how many images match the filters.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/filters.png')
```

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/03c_Filtering_Image_Collection_(exercise)')}
```

## 04. Creating Mosaics and Composites from ImageCollections

The default order of the collection is by date. So when you display the collection, it implicitly creates a mosaic with the latest pixels on top. You can call `.mosaic()` on a ImageCollection to create a mosaic image from the pixels at the top.

We can also create a composite image by applying selection criteria to each pixel from all pixels in the stack. Here we use the `median()` function to create a composite where each pixel value is the median of all pixels from the stack.

> Tip: If you need to create a mosaic where the images are in a specific order, you can use the `.sort()` function to sort your collection by a property first.



```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap='Mosaic vs. Composite'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/mosaic_composite.png')

```{js eval=FALSE}
// Create a median composite for the year 2020 and load it to the map

// Compare both the composites to see the changes in your city
```



## 05. Working with Feature Collections

Feature Collections are similar to Image Collections - but they contain *Features*, not images. They are equivalent to Vector Layers in a GIS. We can load, filter and display Feature Collections using similar techniques that we have learned so far. 

Search for *GAUL Second Level Administrative Boundaries* and load the collection. This is a global collection that contains all Admin2 boundaries. We can apply a filter using the `ADM1_NAME` property to get all Admin2 boundaries (i.e. Districts) from a state.

## 06. Importing Data

You can import vector or raster data into Earth Engine. We will now import a shapefile of [Urban Centres](https://bit.ly/ghs-ucdb-shapefile) from JRC's GHS Urban Centre Database (GHS-UCDB). Unzip the `ne_10m_urban_areas.zip` into a folder on your computer. In the Code Editor, go to *Assets &rarr; New &rarr; Table Upload &rarr; Shape Files*. Select the `.shp`, `.shx`, `.dbf` and .`prj` files. Enter `ghs_urban_centers` as the *Asset Name* and click  *Upload*. Once the upload and ingest finishes, you will have a new asset in the *Assets* tab. The shapefile is imported as a Feature Collection in Earth Engine. Select the `ghs_urban_centers` asset and click *Import*.  You can then visualize the imported data.

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/06c_Import_(exercise)')}
```

## 07. Clipping Images

It is often desirable to clip the images to your area of interest. You can use the `clip()` function to mask out an image using a geometry.

> While in a Desktop software, clipping is desirable to remove unnecessary portion of a large image and save computation time, in Earth Engine clipping can actually increase the computation time. As described in the [Earth Engine Coding Best Practices](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/best_practices?hl=en#if-you-dont-need-to-clip,-dont-use-clip) guide, avoid clipping the images or do it at the end of your script.


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap='Original vs. Clipped Image'}

```{js eval=FALSE}
// Add the imported table to the Map
// Use the Inspector to find the id of your home city or any urban area of your choice
// Change the filter to use the id of the selected feature
```

## 08. Exporting Data

Earth Engine allows for exporting both vector and raster data to be used in an external program. Vector data can be exported as a `CSV` or a `Shapefile`, while Rasters can be exported as `GeoTIFF` files. We will now export the Sentinel-2 Composite as a GeoTIFF file.

> Tip: Code Editor supports autocompletion of API functions using the combination *Ctrl+Space*. Type a few characters of a function and press *Ctrl+Space* to see autocomplete suggestions. You can also use the same key combination to fill all parameters of the function automatically.

Once you run this script, the *Tasks* tab will be highlighted. Switch to the tab and you will see the tasks waiting. Click *Run* next to each task to start the process.  

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/export_task01.png')
```

On clicking the *Run* button, you will be prompted for a confirmation dialog. Verify the settings and click *Run* to start the export.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='40%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/export_task02.png')
```

Once the Export finishes, a GeoTiff file for each export task will be added to your Google Drive in the specified folder. You can download them and use it in a GIS software.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}

# Module 2: Earth Engine Intermediate

Module 2 builds on the basic Earth Engine skills you have gained. This model introduces the parallel programming concepts using Map/Reduce - which is key in effectively using Earth Engine for analyzing large volumes of data. You will learn how to use the Earth Engine API for calculating various spectral indices, do cloud masking and then use map/reduce to do apply these computations to collections of imagery. You will also learn how to take long time-series of data and create charts.

## 01. Earth Engine Objects

This script introduces the basics of the Earth Engine API. When programming in Earth Engine, you must use the Earth Engine API so that your computations can use the Google Earth Engine servers. To learn more, visit [Earth Engine Objects and Methods](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorial_js_02) section of the Earth Engine User Guide. 

[Open in Code Editor &#8599;](https://code.earthengine.google.co.in/?scriptPath=users%2Fujavalgandhi%2FEnd-to-End-GEE%3A02-Earth-Engine-Intermediate%2F01b_Earth_Engine_Objects_(complete)){target="_blank"}

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/02-Earth-Engine-Intermediate/01b_Earth_Engine_Objects_(complete)')}
```


> As a general rule, you should always use Earth Engine API methods in your code, there is one exception where you will need to use client-side Javascript method. If you want to get the current time, the server doesn't know your time. You need to use javascript method and cast it to an Earth Engine object.
  ```
  var now = Date.now()
  print(now)
  var now = ee.Date(now)
  print(now)
  ```

## 02. Calculating Indices

Spectral Indices are central to many aspects of remote sensing. Whether you are studying vegetation or tracking fires - you will need to compute a pixel-wise ratio of 2 or more bands. The most commonly used formula for calculating an index is the *Normalized Difference* between 2 bands. Earth Engine provides a helper function `normalizedDifference()` to help calculate normalized indices, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). For more complex formulae, you can also use the `expression()` function to describe the calculation.

```

## 03. Computation on ImageCollections

So far we have learnt how to run computation on single images. If you want to apply some computation - such as calculating an index - to many images, you need to use `map()`. You first define a function that takes 1 image and returns the result of the computation on that image. Then you can `map()` that function over the ImageCollection which results in a new ImageCollection with the results of the computation. This is similar to a *for-loop* that you maybe familiar with - but using `map()` allows the computation to run in parallel. Learn more at [Mapping over an ImageCollection](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/ic_mapping)

## 04. Cloud Masking

Masking pixels in an image makes those pixels transparent and excludes them from analysis and visualization. To mask an image, we can use the `updateMask()` function and pass it an image with 0 and 1 values. All pixels where the mask image is 0 will be masked.

Most remote sensing datasets come with a QA or Cloud Mask band that contains the information on whether pixels is cloudy or not. Your *Code Editor* contains pre-defined functions for masking clouds for popular datasets under *Scripts Tab &rarr; Examples &rarr; Cloud Masking*. To understand how cloud-masking functions work and learn advanced techniques for bitmasking, please refer to our article on [Working with QA Bands and Bitmasks in Google Earth Engine
](https://spatialthoughts.com/2021/08/19/qa-bands-bitmasks-gee/).

The script below takes the Sentinel-2 masking function and shows how to apply it on an image.

## 05. Reducers

When writing parallel computing code, a *Reduce* operation allows you to compute statistics on a large amount of inputs. In Earth Engine, you need to run reduction operation when creating composites, calculating statistics, doing regression analysis etc. The Earth Engine API comes with a large number of built-in reducer functions (such as `ee.Reducer.sum()`, `ee.Reducer.histogram()`, `ee.Reducer.linearFit()` etc.) that can perform a variety of statistical operations on input data. You can run reducers using the `reduce()` function. Earth Engine supports running reducers on all data structures that can hold multiple values, such as Images (reducers run on different bands), ImageCollection, FeatureCollection, List, Dictionary etc. The script below introduces basic concepts related to reducers.

# Module 3: Supervised Classification

## Introduction to Machine Learning and Supervised Classification

Supervised classification is arguably the most important classical machine learning techniques in remote sensing. Applications range from generating Land Use/Land Cover maps to change detection. Google Earth Engine is unique suited to do supervised classification at scale. The interactive nature of Earth Engine development allows for iterative development of supervised classification workflows by combining many different datasets into the model. This module covers basic supervised classification workflow, accuracy assessment, hyperparameter tuning and change detection.

## 01. Basic Supervised Classification

We will learn how to do a basic land cover classification using training samples collected from the Code Editor using the High Resolution basemap imagery provided by Google Maps. This method requires no prior training data and is quite effective to generate high quality classification samples anywhere in the world. The goal is to classify each source pixel into one of the following classes - urban, bare, water or vegetation. Using the drawing tools in the code editor, you create 4 new feature collection with points representing pixels of that class. Each feature collection has a property called `landcover` with values of 0, 1, 2 or 3 indicating whether the feature collection represents urban, bare, water or vegetation respectively. We then train a *Random Forest* classifier using these training set to build a model and apply it to all the pixels of the image to create a 4 class image.

> Fun fact: The classifiers in Earth Engine API have names starting with **smile** - such as `ee.Classifier.smileRandomForest()`. The *smile* part refers to the [Statistical Machine Intelligence and Learning Engine (SMILE)](https://haifengl.github.io/index.html) JAVA library which is used by Google Earth Engine to implement these algorithms.

```

## 02. Accuracy Assessment

It is important to get a quantitative estimate of the accuracy of the classification. To do this, a common strategy is to divide your training samples into 2 random fractions - one used for *training* the model and the other for *validation* of the predictions. Once a classifier is trained, it can be used to classify the entire image. We can then compare the classified values with the ones in the validation fraction. We can use the `ee.Classifier.confusionMatrix()` method to calculate a *Confusion Matrix* representing expected accuracy.

Classification results are evaluated based on the following metrics

* **Overall Accuracy**: How many samples were classified correctly.
* **Producer’s Accuracy**: How well did the classification predict each class.
* **Consumer’s Accuracy (Reliability)**: How reliable is the prediction in each class.
* **Kappa Coefficient**: How well the classification performed as compared to random assignment.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%', fig.cap='Accuracy Assessment'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/accuracy_assessment.png')
```

> Don't get carried away tweaking your model to give you the highest validation accuracy. You must use both qualitative measures (such as visual inspection of results) along with quantitative measures to assess the results.

```

## 03. Improving the Classification

The Earth Engine data-model is especially well suited for machine learning tasks because of its ability to easily incorporate data sources of different spatial resolutions, projections and data types together By giving additional information to the classifier, it is able to separate different classes easily. Here we take the same example and augment it with the following techniques

* *Apply Cloud Masking*
* *Add Spectral Indices*: We add bands for different spectral indices such as - NDVI, NDBI, MNDWI and BSI. 
* *Add Elevation and Slope*: We also add slope and elevation bands from the ALOS DEM. 
* *Normalize the Inputs*: Machine learning models work best when all the inputs have the same scale. We will divide each band with the maximum value. This method ensures that all input values are between 0-1. A more [complete and robust technique](#image-normalization-and-standardization) for image normalization is provided in the course Supplement.

Our training features have more parameters and contain values of the same scale. The result is a much improved classification.

## 04. Exporting Classification Results

When working with complex classifiers over large regions, you may get a *User memory limit exceeded* or *Computation timed out* error in the Code Editor. The reason for this is that there is a fixed time limit and smaller memory allocated for code that is run with the *On-Demand Computation* mode. For larger computations, you can use the *Batch* mode with the `Export` functions. Exports run in the background and can run longer than 5-minutes time allocated to the computation code run from the Code Editor. This allows you to process very large and complex datasets. Here's an example showing how to export your classification results to Google Drive.

> We can only export Images or FeatureCollections. What if you wanted to export a number that is the result of a long computation? A useful *hack* is to create a FeatureCollection with just 1 feature containing `null` geometry and a property containing the number you want to export.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%', fig.cap='Exported Classification Outputs'}

### Exercise


It is also a good idea to export the classified image as an Asset. This will allows you to import the classified image in another script without running the whole classification workflow. Use the Export.image.toAsset() function to export the classified image as an asset.

## 05. Calculating Area

Now that we have the results of our classification, we will learn how to calculate the area for pixels in each class. Calculating area for features is done using the `area()` function and for images using the `ee.Image.pixelArea()` function. The `ee.Image.pixelArea()` function creates an image where each pixel's value is the area of the pixel. We multiply this pixel area image with our image and sum up the area using the `reduceRegion()` function.

> The `ee.Image.pixelArea()` function uses a custom equal-area projection for area calculation. The result is area in square meters regardless of the projection of the input image. [Learn more](https://groups.google.com/g/google-earth-engine-developers/c/Ccaorx-obVw/m/_ZQdP2wVAgAJ)

# Module 4: Change Detection

## Introduction to Change Detection

Many earth observation datasets are available at regular intervals over long periods of time. This enables us to detect changes on the Earth's surface. Change detection technique in remote sensing fall in the following categories

- **Single Band Change**: Measuring change in a single band image or a spectral index using a threshold
- **Multi Band Change**: Measuring spectral distance and spectral angle between two multiband images
- **Classification of Change**: One-pass classification using stacked image containing bands from before and after an event
- **Post Classification Comparison**: Comparing two classified images and computing class transitions

In the following sections, we will apply the supervised classification techniques for change detection using multi-temporal images.

## 01. Spectral Index Change

Many types of change can be detected by measuring the change in a spectral index and applying a threshold. This technique is suitable when there is a suitable spectral index is available for the type of change you are interested in detecting.

Here we apply this technique to map the extent and severity of a forest fire. The **Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR)** is an index that is designed to highlight burnt vegetation areas. We compute the NBR for before and after images. Then we apply a suitable threshold to find burnt areas.

```

## 02. Spectral Distance Change

When you want to detect changes from multi-band images, a useful technique is to compute the Spectral Distance and Spectral Angle between the two images. Pixels that exhibit a large change will have a larger distance compared to those that did not change. This technique is particularly useful when there are no suitable index to detect the change. It can be applied to detect change after natural disasters or human conflicts.

Here we use this technique to detect landslides using before/after composites. You may learn more about this technique at [Craig D'Souza's Change Detection](https://goo.gl/xotYhk) presentation.

## 03. Direct Classification of Change

This technique of change detection is also known as *One-pass Classification* or *Direct Multi-date Classification*. Here we create a single stacked image containing bands from before and after images. We train a classifier with training data sampled from the stacked image and apply the classifier on the stacked image to find all change pixels.

}

// use addNDBI() function to add the NDBI band to both 2019 and 2020 composite images
// Hint1: You can save the resulting image in the same variable to avoid changing 
// a lot of code.
// var image = addNDBI(image)

```

## 04. Post-classification Comparison

We dealing with multi-class images, a useful metric for change detection is to know how many pixels from class X changed to class Y. This can be accomplished using the `ee.Reducer.frequencyHistogram()` reducer as shown below.

# Module 5: Earth Engine Apps

This module is focused the concepts related to client vs. server that will help you in creating web apps. We will be building an app using the Earth Engine User Interface API and publishing it to Google Cloud.

## 01. Client vs. Server

The User Interface elements in your Code Editor - Map View, Drawing Tools etc. are 'client-side' elements. They run in YOUR browser. Image Collections, feature collections, calculations on Earth Engine objects etc. are 'server-side' elements. They run in Google's data center. You cannot mix both these objects. To learn more, visit the [Client vs. Server](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/client_server) section of the Earth Engine User Guide.

* To convert client-side objects to server-side objects, you can use the appropriate API function. Server-side functions start with `ee.`, such `ee.Date()`, `ee.Image()` etc.
* To convert server-side objects to client-side objects, you can call `.getInfo()` on am Earth Engine object. For the Python API, this is the only way to extract information from a server-side object, but the Javascript API provides a better (and preferred) - method for bring server-side objects to client-side using the `evaluate()` method. This method asynchronously retrieves the value of the object, without blocking the user interface - meaning it will let your code continue to execute while it fetches the value. 

> Tip: You can use `ee.Algorithms.ObjectType()` to get the type of a server-side object

## 02. Using UI Elements

Earth Engine comes with a User Interface API that allows you to build an interactive web application powered by Earth Engine.

The Earth Engine API provides a library of User Interface (UI) widgets - such as Buttons, Drop-down Menus, Sliders etc. - that can be used to create interactive apps. All the user interface functions are contained in the `ui.` package - such as `ui.Select()`, `ui.Button()`. You can create those elements by calling these functions with appropriate parameters. Learn more in the [Earth Engine User Interface API](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/ui) section of the Earth Engine User Guide.

This section shows how to build a drop-down selector using the `ui.Select()` widget.

## 03. Building and Publishing an App

Building a web mapping application typically requires the skills of a full stack developer and are out of reach for most analysts and scientists. But the Earth Engine User Interface API makes this process much more accessible by providing ready-to-use widgets and free cloud hosting to allow anyone to publish an app with just a few lines of code.  The main container object is the `ui.Panel()` which can contain different types of widgets. 

The code below shows how to build an app called [Night Lights Explorer](https://santhosh-m.users.earthengine.app/view/night-lights-explorer) that allows anyone to pick a year/month and load the *VIIRS Nighttime Day/Night Band Composite* for the selected month. Copy/paste the code below to your Code Editor and click *Run*.


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/app1.png')
```

You will see a panel on the right-hand side with 2 drop-down boxes and a button. These are User Interface (UI) widgets provided by the Earth Engine API that allows the user to interactively select the values. You can select the values for *year* and *month* and click *Load* button to see the image for the selected month.

```{js eval=FALSE}
// Exercise
// Add a button called 'Reset'
// Clicking the button should remove all loaded layers

// Hint: Use Map.clear() for removing the layers
```

## 04. Publishing the App

We will now publish this app. Click on the *Apps* button.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap='App with UI Elements'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/app2.png')
```


In the *Manage Apps* window, click *New App*.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/app3.png')
```

Enter the name of your app. The app will be hosted on Google Cloud, so you will need to create and link a Google Cloud project with the app. If you don't have a Google Cloud account, you can click the *Not Yet* button to create a new project.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/app4.png')
```

When prompted to *Choose a Cloud Project for your apps*, you can select *Create a new Cloud Project* and enter an unique id and click *Select*.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/app5.png')
```

You may get an error asking you to accept the terms of service. Click the *Cloud Terms of Service* link and follow the instructions. Once done, click *OK*.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/app6.png')
```

Back in the *Publish New App* dialog, leave all other settings to default and click *Publish*.


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/app7.png')
```

The app will be hosted on Google Cloud and you can access it by clicking on the *App Name* of your app in the *Manage Apps* dialog.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/app8.png')
```

You will see your Earth Engine powered app running in the browser. Anyone can access and interact with the app by just visiting the App URL.

> The app publishing process takes a few minutes. So if you get an error that your app is not yet ready, check back in a few minutes.

```

## 05. Create a Split Panel App

Another useful widget that can be used in Apps is `ui.SplitPanel()`. This allows you to create an app that can display 2 different images of the same region that can be explored interactively by swiping. Here we create an app to explore the [ESA WorldCover 10m](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ESA_WorldCover_v100) global classification dataset. 

On the left-hand panel, we will load a Sentinel-2 composite for the year 2020. On the right-hand panel, we will load the 11-class landcover classification of the same region.

# Module 6: Google Earth Engine Python API

## Introduction to the Python API

Till this point in the course, we have used the Earth Engine Javascript API for all our analysis. Earth Engine also provides a Python API. If you are a Python programmer, you may prefer to use the Python API to integrate Earth Engine in your spatial analysis workflow. There are many options for running Python code that uses the Google Earth Engine API. We will use the following two methods in this course.


[![View Presentation](images/end_to_end_gee/python_api.png){width="400px"}](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hPVRnxp2Vp1VHXBtu36SH_UtEOjPz70KcDV-zGIin3U/edit?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}

[View the Presentation &#8599;](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hPVRnxp2Vp1VHXBtu36SH_UtEOjPz70KcDV-zGIin3U/edit?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}


### Google Colab

An easy way to start using the Google Earth Engine Python API is via [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Google Colaboratory provides a hosted environment to run Python notebooks without having to install Python locally. It also comes pre-installed with many useful packages - including the Google Earth Engine Python API. You can simply visit https://colab.research.google.com/ and start a new notebook. 


### Local Development Environment

An advantage of Python API is that you can use it in your own development environment - so you get a lot more flexibility to automate as well as combine other analysis and visualization libraries with Earth Engine. This requires installing Python and the Earth Engine Python API on your machine or server. You also need to do a one-time authentication and save the token on the machine. The preferred method for installing the Earth Engine Python API is via Anaconda. Please follow our [Google Earth Engine Python API Installation Guide](install-gee-python-api.html) for step-by-step instructions.


## 01. Python API Syntax

[Open in Google Colab &#8599;](https://colab.research.google.com/github/spatialthoughts/courses/blob/master/code/end_to_end_gee/01_python_api_syntax.ipynb){target="_blank"}

```{r child='end-to-end-gee-output/01_python_api_syntax.md'}
```


## 02. Automatic Conversion of Javascript Code to Python

[Open in Google Colab &#8599;](https://colab.research.google.com/github/spatialthoughts/courses/blob/master/code/end_to_end_gee/02_automatic_conversion_of_scripts.ipynb){target="_blank"}


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap='Interactive leaflet map created by geemap'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/automatic_conversion.png')
```


```{r child='end-to-end-gee-output/02_automatic_conversion_of_scripts.md'}
```


## 03. Batch Exports

[Open in Google Colab &#8599;](https://colab.research.google.com/github/spatialthoughts/courses/blob/master/code/end_to_end_gee/03_export_a_collection.ipynb){target="_blank"}

```{r child='end-to-end-gee-output/03_export_a_collection.md'}
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap='Launching multiple tasks using the  Python API'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/exporting_a_collection.png')
```

## 04. Creating Charts in Python

[Open in Google Colab &#8599;](https://colab.research.google.com/github/spatialthoughts/courses/blob/master/code/end_to_end_gee/04_creating_charts.ipynb){target="_blank"}

```{r child='end-to-end-gee-output/04_creating_charts.md'}
```

## 05. Automating Downloads

Another common use of the GEE Python API is to automate data processing and export. You can create a Python script that can be called from a server or launched on a schedule using tools such as [Windows Scheduler](https://medium.com/@roddyjaques/how-to-run-anaconda-programs-with-a-bat-file-5f6dd7675508) or [crontab](https://donny-son.github.io/posts/cronjob-with-conda/). 

This script below provides a complete example of automating a download using Google Earth Engine API. It uses the Google Earth Engine API to compute the average soil moisture for the given time period over all districts in a state. The result is then downloaded as a JSON file and saved locally.

> Make sure you have completed the [one-time authentication flow](install-gee-python-api.html#authentication) before running the script.

Follow the steps below to create a script to download data from GEE. 


1. Create a new file named `download_data.py` with the content shown below.

```{py eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/download_data.py')}
``` 

2. From the terminal, navigate to the directory where you have created the file and type the command below to run the script.

```
python download_data.py
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/download2.png')
```

3. The script will download the data from GEE and save a file to your current directory.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/end_to_end_gee/download3.png')
```
