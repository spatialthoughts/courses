# 1. Operators and Conditionals

In this section, we will learn about operators and conditions used in QGIS expressions and learn how to use them to select and extract features from layers.

1. Open QGIS. Navigate to the folder containing the data package. Locate and open the **Power_Plants** project. This project contains 2 data layers. A point layer named `power_plants` containing locations of all power plants in the world and a polygon layer named `admin1` with states/province boundaries for all countries. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/operator1.png')
```

2. Select the `power_plants` layer and click *Open Attribute Table* button. You will see that the layer as a column named `primary_fuel` describing the primary energy source used in electricity generation. We can use this to select different types of power plants.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/operator2.png')
```

3. We will now use an expressions to select features from this layer. From the *Selection Toolbar*, click the *Select Features by Expression...* button.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/operator3.png')
```

4. In the *Expression* dialog, locate the **primary_fuel** attribute under *Fields and Values* group. Double-click to add it to the expression. While the field is selected, click the *All Unique* button to show all unique values contained in that field. Here we want to select all Coal power plants, so enter the expression as below and click *Select Features*.

```
"primary_fuel" = 'Coal'
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/operator4.png')
```

5. In the main QGIS window, you will see the features matching the expression selected in yellow color. We could select all Coal power plants. What if we want to select all power plants that use renewable energy source? We need to be able to specify multiple fuel types for the query. Let's update the expression. From the *Selection Toolbar*, click the *Select Features by Expression...* again.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/operator5.png')
```

6. We can use the **IN** operator to specify a list of fuel types that we want to select. Enter the following expression and click *Select Features*.

```
"primary_fuel" IN ('Biomass', 'Geothermal', 'Hydro', 'Solar', 'Wind', 'Storage', 'Wave and Tidal')
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/operator6.png')
```

7. You will now see all power plants with renewable fuel types selected. Click the *Deselect Features from All Layers* button.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/operator7.png')
```

8. Next, we will learn how we can use expressions to extract certain features into a new layer. Open the Processing Toolbox from **Processing &rarr; Toolbox**. Search and locate the algorithm **Vector selection &rarr; Extract by expression** and double-click to launch it.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/operator8.png')
```

9.  In the *Vector Selection - Extract by Expression* dialog, select ``power_plants`` as the *Input layer*. Click the *Expression* button.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/operator9.png')
```

10. Enter the following expression to extract all hydro power plants and click *OK*.

```
"primary_fuel" = 'Hydro'
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/operator10.png')
```

11. Click the *...* next to *Matching Features* and select **Save to File...**. Enter the name of the output file as ``hydro_power_plants.gpkg`` and click *Run*.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/operator11.png')
```

12. Once the processing finishes, a new layer `hydro_power_plants` will be added to the *Layers* panel. Open the attribute table and verify that all the power plants have *Hydro* as the `primary_fuel`. Next, we will learn how to classify these power plants based on their capacity. The column `capacity_mw` has electrical generating capacity in megawatts. You may now turn off the visibility of the `power_plants` layer.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/operator12.png')
```

13. Select the `hydro_power_plants` layer. From the Processing Toolbox, search and locate the algorithm **Vector table &rarr; Field calculator** and double-click to launch it.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/operator13.png')
```

14. In the *Vector Table - Field Calculator* dialog, select `hydro_power_plants` as the *Input Layer*. Enter **classification** as the *Field name*. Keep **Text (string)** as the *Result field type*.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/operator14.png')
```

15. We want to assign one of the categories from Small, Medium and Large to each power plant based on the capacity. We can use the `CASE` statement to assign different values based on different conditions. Enter the following expression.

```
CASE
WHEN  "capacity_mw" < 25 THEN 'Small'
WHEN  "capacity_mw" >= 25 AND  "capacity_mw" <= 100 THEN 'Medium'
WHEN  "capacity_mw" > 100 THEN 'Large'
END
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/operator15.png')
```

16. Click the *...* next to *Calculated* and select **Save to File...**. Enter the name of the output file as ``hydro_power_plants_classification.gpkg`` and click *Run*.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/operator16.png')
```

17. Once the processing finishes, a new layer `hydro_power_plants_classification` will be added to the *Layers* panel. Open the attribute table and see the assigned values in the *classification* column.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/operator17.png')
```

We have now finished the first part of this exercise. You can load the `Power_Plants_CheckPoint1.qgz` project in the `solutions` folder to catch up to this point and do the challenge.

## Challenge 1

Create a new layer containing only the **Large** hydro power plants in your country. The `country` column contains 3-digit ISO codes for each country. Pick a country and build an expression to extract the features.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/challenge1.png')
```

# 2. Functions

We will now learn how to use the expression functions for spatial analysis. Our goal will be to get a list of hydro power plants and the total installed capacity for each admin1 region in a country.

1. Continuing from the previous section, remove all layers except the `admin1` and `hydro_power_plants_classification` layers. We will now apply a filter to each of these layers to keep only the features for our chosen country. Right=click the `hydro_power_plants_classification` layer and choose *Filter...*.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/functions1.png')
```

2. In the *Query Builder* dialog, enter the following expression and click *OK*. You may replace **SWE** with the 3-digit ISO code for your country.

```
"country" = 'SWE'
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/functions2.png')
```

3. Next, right-click the `admin1` layer and select *Filter...*.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/functions3.png')
```

4. In the *Query Builder* dialog, enter the following expression and click *OK*.

```
"adm0_a3" = 'SWE'
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/functions4.png')
```

5. Both the layers now have an active filter applied to them and you should only see features for the chosen country. Select the `hydro_power_plants_classification` layer and open the Attribute Table. Note that the column `name` contains the name of the power plant and the column `capacity_mw` contains the power generation capacity.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/functions5.png')
```

6. Select the `admin1` layer and open the Processing Toolbox from **Processing &rarr; Toolbox**. Search and locate the algorithm **Vector table &rarr; Field calculator** and double-click to launch it.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/functions6.png')
```

7. In the *Vector Table - Field Calculator* dialog, select `admin1` as the *Input Layer*. Enter **power_plants_list** as the *Field name*. Select **Text (string)** as the *Result field type*.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/functions7.png')
```

8. We want to find the names of all power plant features intersecting each admin1 polygon. The `overlay_intersect()` function allows you to locate intersecting features from another layer. Enter the following expression.

```
overlay_intersects(
  layer:='hydro_power_plants_classification',
  expression:="name"
)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/functions8.png')
```

9. In the *Preview* below the expression, you can see the output is a list of matching power plants for admin1 region. To save this list to the output layer, we need to convert it to a string. We can use the `array_to_string()` function to turn the list into a string with comma-separated values. Update the expression as follows.


```
array_to_string(
  overlay_intersects(
    layer:='hydro_power_plants_classification',
    expression:="name"
  )
)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/functions9.png')
```


10. Click the *...* next to *Calculated* and select **Save to File...**. Enter the name of the output file as ``admin1_power_plant_list.gpkg`` and click *Run*.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/functions10.png')
```

11. Once the processing finishes, a new layer `admin1_power_plant_list` will be added to the *Layers* panel. Open the attribute table and verify that the *power_plants_list* has the list of intersecting power plant names. Next, we will add another column with the total capacity for each region. Open the **Vector table &rarr; Field calculator** algorithm from the Processing Toolbox.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/functions11.png')
```

12. In the *Vector Table - Field Calculator* dialog, select `admin1_power_plant_list` as the *Input Layer*. Enter **total_hydro_capacity** as the *Field name*. Select **Decimal (double)** as the *Result field type*.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/functions12.png')
```

13. Similar to the previous step, we can use the `overlay_intersects()` function to get a list of values for the *capacity_mw* attribute for all intersecting power plant features. As we want to calculate the total capacity, we can use the `array_sum()` function to calculate the total. Enter the following expression.

```
array_sum(
  overlay_intersects(
    layer:='hydro_power_plants_classification',
    expression:="capacity_mw"
  )
)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/functions13.png')
```

14. Click the *...* next to *Calculated* and select **Save to File...**. Enter the name of the output file as ``admin1_power_plant_capacity.gpkg`` and click *Run*.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/functions14.png')
```

15. Once the processing finishes, a new layer `hydro_power_plant_capacity` will be added to the *Layers* panel. Open the attribute table and you will notice that the *total_hydro_capacity* has the sum of the capacities of all hydro power plants within each region.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/functions15.png')
```

16. We are done with the analysis, but often times it i desirable to share the results with others in a non-spatial format. We will not clean up our output and save the data as a spreadsheet. Search and locate the **Vector table &rarr; Refactor fields** algorithm and double-click to launch it.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/functions16.png')
```

17. Our attribute table contains over 100 columns. We can delete most of them and only keep a few columns in the output. In the *Fields mapping* section, hold the *Shift* key and click on the row numbers to select them. Once selected, click the *Delete selected field* button to remove it from the output.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/functions17.png')
```

18. For the final output, only keep the `name`, `power_plants_list` and `total_hydro_capacity` fields.  Click the *...* next to *Refactored* and select **Save to File...**.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/functions18.png')
```

19. In the *Save file* dialog, choose **XLSX files (*.xlsx)** as the *Save as type*. Enter the name of the output file as ``admin1_hydro_power_plant_data`` and click *Save*.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/functions19.png')
```

20. Un-check the *Open output file after running algorithm* box and click *Run*.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/functions20.png')
```

21. Once the processing finishes, open the resulting spreadsheet in Excel or Open Office Calc to see the output.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/functions21.png')
```

22. Back in QGIS, we are ready to do the next challenge. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/functions22.png')
```

You can load the `Power_Plants_CheckPoint2.qgz` project in the `solutions` folder to catch up to this point and do the challenge.

## Challenge 2

Add a new column **power_plant_count** with the total number of hydro power plants in each admin1 region.

Hint: Look under the `array_` section to find a suitable function for calculating number of items in a list.

# 3. Geometries

In this section, we will learn how to create and manipulate feature geometry using expressions. The QGIS expression engine comes with a large number of functions that can be used to create, update, transform geometries of features. 

1. Locate and open the **Nearest_Neighbor** project. This project contains 2 point layers. The layer `schools` has the locations schools and the layer `colleges` has locations of all the colleges in the state of Kerala, India. Our goal for this section is to connect each school point to the nearest college point with a line.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/geometry1.png')
```

2. Select the `schools` layer and click the *Open the Layer Styling Panel* button. The layer is styled using the **Simple Marker** symbol layer. Click the *Add symbol layer* / *+* button.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/geometry2.png')
```

3. A new symbol layer of type **Simple Marker** will be added. Click on the dropdown next to *Symbol layer type* and choose **Geometry Generator** as the *Symbol layer type*. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/geometry3.png')
```

4. *Geometry Generator* is a special layer type that allows us to write an expression to create new geometries and render them on-the-fly with chosen symbology. As we want to create and render a line, choose **LineString / MultiLineString** as the *Geometry type*. Next, click the *Expression* button.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/geometry4.png')
```

5. We want to find the nearest college to each school feature. The `overlay_nearest()` function allows us to find nearest features from another layer. We build an expression to find the `@geometry` of the nearest college and then use the `make_line()` function to create a line from the school point to the nearest college point. Enter the following expression and click *OK*.

```
make_line(
	@geometry,
	overlay_nearest(
		layer:='colleges',
		expression:=@geometry,
		limit:=1
	)
)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/geometry5.png')
```

6. You will see the map update and show lines connecting each school feature to the nearest college. These lines are being constructed and rendered on-the-fly using the specified expression. The underlying data-source does not change in any way. Geometry Generator symbol layers are particularly useful for such applications to dynamically visualize the data in a different way. Let's update the expression. Click the *Expression* button.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/geometry6.png')
```

7. The `overlay_nearest()` function has an optional parameter `max_distance` that allows us to specify the maximum search distance and only return the feature from another layer within the specified distance. Let's update the expression to find the nearest college within 5km (5000 meters) distance.

```
make_line(
	@geometry,
	overlay_nearest(
		layer:='colleges',
		expression:=@geometry,
		limit:=1,
		max_distance:=5000
	)
)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/geometry7.png')
```

8. The map will update to show the line connections only between schools and colleges within 5km distance.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/geometry8.png')
```

We have now finished this section. You can load the `Nearest_Neighbor_CheckPoint1.qgz` project in the `solutions` folder to catch up to this point and do the challenge.

## Challenge 3

The Processing Toolbox comes with a handy tool called *Geometry by expression*. This algorithm allows you to take an input layer and create a new layer by transforming the geometries using expression. Use this tool to create a new layer `schools_with_nearest_college.gpkg` showing the connections from school points to the nearest college.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/challenge3.png')
```


# 4. Iteration

The QGIS expression engine has array functions that allow you to iterate and process each item from the array using expressions. This enables some very powerful use-cases. In this section we will explore the `array_foreach()` and `array_filter()` functions.

1. Continuing from the previous section, select the `schools` layer and open the **Vector table &rarr; Field calculator** algorithm from the Processing Toolbox.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/iteration1.png')
```

2. In the *Vector Table - Field Calculator* dialog, select `schools` as the *Input Layer*. Enter **colleges** as the *Field name*. Select **Text (string)** as the *Result field type*.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/iteration2.png')
```

3. We want to get the list of college names within 5km of each school. Enter the following expression and see the output shown in the *Preview*.

```
overlay_nearest(
	layer:='colleges',
	expression:="collegename",
	max_distance:=5000,
	limit:=-1
)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/iteration3.png')
```

4. Let's say we want to convert each name to title case. We can use the `array_foreach()` function which allows us to run an expression on each item. Within the function, you refer to each item in the array with the variable `@element`. Update the expression as below.

```
array_foreach(
	overlay_nearest(
		layer:='colleges',
		expression:="collegename",
		max_distance:=5000,
		limit:=-1
	),
	title(@element)
)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/iteration4.png')
```

5. Before saving the results, let's convert the resulting array to a comma-separated string. Update the expression as shown below and click the *...* next to *Calculated* and select **Save to File...**. Enter the name of the output file as ``nearest_colleges.gpkg`` and click *Run*.

```
array_to_string(
	array_foreach(
		overlay_nearest(
			layer:='colleges',
			expression:="collegename",
			max_distance:=5000,
			limit:=-1
		),
		title(@element)
	)
)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/iteration5.png')
```

6.  Once the processing finishes, a new layer `nearest_colleges` will be added to the *Layers* panel. Open the attribute table and you will notice that the *colleges* column has the list of colleges in title case. Open the **Vector table &rarr; Field calculator** algorithm again.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/iteration6.png')
```

7. In the *Vector Table - Field Calculator* dialog, select `nearest_colleges` as the *Input Layer*. Enter **science_colleges** as the *Field name*. Select **Text (string)** as the *Result field type*.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/iteration7.png')
```

8. From our list of colleges, we want to select only the colleges with the word **Science** in their names. To achieve this, we can use the `array_filter()` function to iterate through each item and check if the text is present. This can be achieved using the `regexp_match()` function. Enter the expression as below.

```
array_to_string(
  array_filter(
  	array_foreach(
  		overlay_nearest(
  			layer:='colleges',
  			expression:="collegename",
  			max_distance:=5000,
  			limit:=-1
  		),
  		title(@element)
  	),
  	regexp_match(@element, 'Science')
  )
)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/iteration8.png')
```

9. Click the *...* next to *Calculated* and select **Save to File...**. Enter the name of the output file as ``nearest_science_colleges.gpkg`` and click *Run*.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/iteration9.png')
```

10. Once the processing finishes, a new layer `nearest_science_colleges` will be added to the *Layers* panel. Open the attribute table and you will notice that the *science_colleges* column has the list of colleges containing the keyword *Science*.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/iteration10.png')
```

11. Select both the `nearest_colleges` and `nearest_science_colleges` layers. Right-click and select *Remove Layer*.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/iteration11.png')
```

12. We will now apply these concept of iteration and filtering to our problem of connecting schools to the nearest college. We will apply an additional criteria to connect each school to the nearest college that **belongs to the same district as the school**. Let's update the expression to apply this filter. Select the `schools` layer and click the *Open the Layer Styling Panel* button. Select the *Geometry Generator* symbol layer.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/iteration12.png')
```

13. We will update the `overlay_nearest()` function to return us the list of `@feature` instead of `@geometry`. This will allow us to run the filter on the attributes. We then use `array_filter()` to select all college features where the value of *district* is the same as the value of *district* for the school. Finally we select the first matching feature using `[0]` and use `geometry()` to extract the geometry of the feature. The final expression for creating a line from the school to the nearest college in the same district is as follows.

```
make_line(
	@geometry,
	geometry(array_filter(
		overlay_nearest(
			layer:='colleges',
			expression:=@feature,
			max_distance:=5000,
			limit:=-1
		),
	"district"=attribute(@element, 'district'))[0])
)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/iteration13.png')
```

14. Once you apply the expression, the map will update and you will see that each school is now connected to the nearest college that belongs to the same administrative area.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/iteration14.png')
```

You can now load the `Nearest_Neighbor_CheckPoint2.qgz` project in the `solutions` folder to catch up to this point and do the challenge.

## Challenge 4

You will notice that there are many schools with no connection to colleges. The challenge is select all schools which have no nearby college in the same district. You can use the *Select by expression* algorithm in the Processing Toolbox to select features using an expression. 

Hint: Use the `array_filter()` expression from above and build an expression to select features where `array_length()` is 0.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_expressions/challenge4.png')
```

## Saving and Sharing Expressions

QGIS expression editor allows you to [save expressions](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/expressions/expression.html#saving-expressions) that can be used later on. If you have an expression that you want to save, click the *Add current expression to user expressions* button in the expression editor. The expression will be saved with your chosen name in a special group **User Expression**. The saved expression can then be accessed anytime. You can also share your saved expression with other QGIS users using the *Export user expressions* button which they can import into their QGIS installation.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
