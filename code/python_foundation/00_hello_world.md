# Hello World

When learning a new programming language, it is customary to first learn how to print 'Hello World!'. While a bit quirky, it is a useful first step to know how to send input to the program and where to see the output. In Python, you can use the built-in ``print()`` function to print the greeting ``"Hello World!"``


```python
print('Hello World!')
```
