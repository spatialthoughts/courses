# Installation and Setting up the Environment

## Install QGIS

This workshop requires QGIS LTR version 3.40. Please review [QGIS-LTR Installation Guide](install-qgis-ltr.html) for step-by-step instructions.

## Get a Text Editor

Any kind of software development requires a good text editor. If you already have a favorite text editor or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), you may use it for this workshop. Otherwise, each platform offers a wide variety of free or paid options for text editors. Choose the one that fits your needs.

Below are my recommendations editors that are simple to use for beginners.

- Windows: [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) is a good free editor for windows. Download and install the Notepad++ editor. Tip: Before writing Python code in Notepad+++, make sure to go to Settings &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Language and enable `Replace by space`. Python is very sensitive about whitespace and this setting will ensure tabs and spaces are treated properly.
- Mac: [TextMate](https://macromates.com/) is an open-source editor for Mac that is currently available for free.


## Get the Data Package

We have created a data package containing ready-to-use plugin files for each section. You can download the data package from [qgis_plugin_workshop.zip](https://github.com/spatialthoughts/courses/releases/download/data/qgis_plugin_workshop.zip). Once downloaded, unzip the contents to a folder on your computer.


# Get the Workshop Video

The course is accompanied by a video covering the all the sections This video is recorded from our live webinar class and is edited to make them easier to consume for self-study. We have 2 versions of the videos:

## YouTube

The video on YouTube is ideal for online learning and sharing. You may also turn on *Subtitles/closed-captions* and adjust the playback speed to suit your preference. [Access the YouTube Video &#8599;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXaD6xyq7m0){target="_blank"}

We have also made full-length video available on Vimeo. This video can be downloaded for offline learning. [Access the Vimeo Video &#8599;](https://vimeo.com/1097319830?share=copy){target="_blank"}


# Building a Plugin

The workshop will teach you how to build a plugin named **Basemap Loader** that adds a toolbar to QGIS allowing you to pick and easily load your favorite basemaps.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%', fig.cap='The Basemap Loader Plugin'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_plugin_workshop/basemap_loader.gif')
```


## 1. Create a Minimal Plugin

We will now build a simple plugin named **Basemap Loader** that adds a button in the *Plugin Toolbar* that loads a basemap from OpenStreetMap to the current project. To understand the required structure, let's see what a minimal plugin looks like. You can learn more about this structure at [QGIS Minimalist Plugin Skeleton](https://github.com/wonder-sk/qgis-minimal-plugin).

1. The first requirement for plugins is a file called `metadata.txt`. This file contains general info, version, name and some other metadata used by plugins website and plugin manager. 

`metadata.txt`
```{python eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/qgis_plugin_workshop/basemap_loader_minimal/metadata.txt')}
```

2. Second is the file that contains the main logic of the plugin. It must have `__init__()` method that gives the plugin access to the QGIS Interface (iface). The `initGui()` method is called when the plugin is loaded and `unload()` method which is called when the plugin is unloaded. For now, we are creating a minimal plugin that just add a button and a menu entry that displays message when clicked.

`main.py`
```{python eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/qgis_plugin_workshop/basemap_loader_minimal/main.py')}
```

3. Third file is called `__init__.py` which is the starting point of the plugin. It imports the plugin class created in the second file and creates an instance of it.

`__init__.py`
```{python eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/qgis_plugin_workshop/basemap_loader_minimal/__init__.py')}
```

4. Create these 3 files and put them in a folder named `basemap_loader`. Copy the `logo.png` file from your data package and copy to this folder. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_plugin_workshop/pluginbasemapfiles.png')
```

5. Next we need to copy the folder to the appropriate directory so QGIS loads it at startup. Open your profile folder by going to **Settings &rarr; User Profiles &rarr; Open Active Profile Folder**

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_plugin_workshop/active_profile_folder1.png')
```

6. Locate the python plugins directory at `{profile folder}/python/plugins`. Copy the entire folder to this directory.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_plugin_workshop/active_profile_folder2.png')
```

7. Restart QGIS. Go to  **Plugins &rarr; Manage and Install plugins... &rarr; Installed** and enable the **Basemap Loader** plugin.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_plugin_workshop/enable_plugin.png')
```

8. You will the toolbar icon from the plugin. Click on the button and the *Hello from Plugin* message is displayed. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_plugin_workshop/pluginbasemaphello.png')
```

Your data package contains a folder `basemap_loader_minimal` with all the required files created for this section. You may use them directly to catch up to this point in the workshop.

## 2. Add Core Functionality

Now let's build on the basic plugin structure and add the functionality to load a XYZ Tile Layer when the button is clicked. We will be using the [OpenStreetMap Standard](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Raster_tile_providers#Base_maps) XYZ layer. The PyQGIS code to load a XYZ tile layer is adapted from the [PyQGIS Cookbook](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/cheat_sheet.html). 

1. Modify the `main.py` file with the content from below.

`main.py`
```{python eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/qgis_plugin_workshop/basemap_loader_complete/main.py')}
```

2. To see the result of our changes, we must restart QGIS. This can be quite tedious while developing plugins, so there is a handy plugin named **Plugin Reloader** that can reload a selected plugin without having to restart QGIS. Go to  **Plugins &rarr; Manage and Install plugins... &rarr; All** and search for the plugin named **Plugin Reloader**. Click *Install Plugin*. Once the plugin is installed, locate the *Configure* button from the *Plugin Toolbar* and select the **Basemap Loader** plugin. Click *Reload* to reload the plugin.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_plugin_workshop/pluginbasemapreload.png')
```

3. Once reloaded, click the *Load Basemap* button from the toolbar and you will see the basemap layer loaded in QGIS.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_plugin_workshop/pluginbasemapcomplete.png')
```

Your data package contains a folder `basemap_loader_complete` with all the required files created for this section. You may use them directly to catch up to this point in the workshop.

## 3. Add User Interface

We will now add some user-interface widget to the plugin. Instead of a button that loads a single basemap, we can build a toolbar that has a drop-down menu of many options that the user can pick from and load the basemap.

For a comprehensive list of basemap tile-services and their URLs, you can see the [Contextily Providers](https://contextily.readthedocs.io/en/latest/providers_deepdive.html) page.

1. Modify the `main.py` file with the content from below.

`main.py`
```{python eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/qgis_plugin_workshop/basemap_loader_ui/main.py')}
```

2. Reload the plugin to see the toolbar.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_plugin_workshop/pluginbasemapui.png')
```

Your data package contains a folder `basemap_loader_ui` with all the required files created for this section. You may use them directly to catch up to this point in the workshop.


## 4. Package and Share Your Plugin

1. The easiest way to share your plugin with other users is by creating a ZIP file. Right-click the plugin directory and create a zip file.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_plugin_workshop/compress.png')
```

2. You can send the resulting `basemap_loader.zip` file to other users. You may also host this file and share the link with other users. For example, the final plugin can be downloaded from this link &rarr; [basemap_loader.zip](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1_0liBiBP18x4y2CVNswtkt_lK0e-qiCu). Once downloaded, the plugin can be installed from **Plugins &rarr; Manage and Install plugins... &rarr; Install from ZIP**. Click *Install Plugin* to install the plugin.

> You will get a warning *Installing a plugin from an untrusted source can harm the computer. Only continue if you received the plugin from a source you trust. Continue?*. Click *Yes* to continue the installation.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_plugin_workshop/install.png')
```

3. Switch to to  *Installed* table and enable the **Basemap Loader** plugin.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/qgis_plugin_workshop/enable_plugin.png')
```
