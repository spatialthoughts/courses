# Introduction 

This is an advanced-level course that teaches you how to use open-source Python libraries to process earth observation dataset using cloud and parallel-computing technologies. We have designed this course to help you build the required skills in a structured way and offer flexibility in where your data is stored and how it is processed.

# 1. Learning XArray

[`XArray`](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/) has emerged as one of the key Python libraries to work with gridded raster datasets. It can natively handle time-series data making it ideal for working with Remote Sensing datasets. It builds on NumPy/Pandas for fast arrays/indexing and is orders of magnitude faster than other Python libraries like `rasterio`. It has a growing ecosystem of extensions `rioxarray`, `xarray-spatial`, `XEE` and more allowing it to be used for geospatial analysis. In this section, we will learn the fundamentals of XArray with a focus on earth observation data processing. XArray offers the flexibility to seamlessly work with local datasets along with cloud-hosted datasets in a variety of optimized data formats.

```


# Scaling Computation with Dask

[`Dask`](https://www.dask.org/) is a python library to run your computation in parallel across many machines. Dask has built-in support for key geospatial packages like XArray and Pandas allowing you to scale your computation easily. You can choose to run your code in parallel on your laptop, a machine in the cloud, local or cloud cluster of machines etc.


## Calculating Zonal Statistics

```{r child='python-remote-sensing-output/zonal_statistics.md'}
```

## Computing Climate Trends
