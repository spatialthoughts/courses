# Introduction 

XArray is a powerful Python package for working with climate and earth observation datasets. Inspired by libraries like pandas - it is particularly suited for working with multi-dimensional time-series raster datasets. With the growing ecosystem of spatial extensions like rioxarray and xarray-spatial and built-in support for parallel computing with Dask, it has become the de-facto standard for working with large spatio-temporal raster datasets. This workshop will show you how you can use it to effectively process large volumes of earth observation data using cloud-based datasets.


# Notebooks and Datasets

This workshop uses Google Colab for all exercises. You do not need to install any packages or download any datasets. 

The notebooks can be accessed by clicking on the ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg) buttons at the beginning of each section. Once you have opened the notebook in Colab, you can copy it to your own account by going to *File &rarr; Save a Copy in Drive*. 


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/common/colab1.png')
```

Once the notebooks are saved to your drive, you will be able to modify the code and save the updated copy. You can also click the *Share* button and share a link to the notebook with others.
